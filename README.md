# daily-tracker

## Description
This is a daily work day schedule. There are time blocks for each hour of the work day that the user can input text into; like upcoming meetings, etc. and save. The blocks are color coded to show the past, present, and future of the time. This is a great way to keep track of all your daily work tasks or even as a reminder to take a break!

## Usage
Type anything you want into the input boxes for the desired time and click save.  Once that time is over the time block will be grey, the future in red, and the present in green.
